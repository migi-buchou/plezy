this is a personal fork of [Plezy](https://github.com/edde746/plezy) by edde746 to allow plezy to sync to anilist when your anime library is managed by [Shokofin](https://github.com/ShokoAnime/Shokofin). this might work for the jellyfin anidb plugin as well, or other tracking sites such as MAL or simkl, but i dont use them and havent tested it. **currently shoko groups arent supported and only the default layout works right**. with groups only season 1 will sync. i might fix this in the future

**you should probably not have tmdb or tvdb ids enabled in your shokofin settings to avoid syncing progress to the wrong anime.**

the change is currently only on the `anidb-jellyfin` branch.

<details>
<summary>Install with a package manager</summary>

### macOS — Homebrew

```bash
brew tap edde746/plezy https://github.com/edde746/plezy
brew install --cask plezy
```

### Windows — WinGet

```bash
winget install edde746.Plezy
```

### Linux — Flatpak

Install Flatpak with your distribution's package manager, download the bundle for your architecture above, then run:

```bash
flatpak remote-add --user --if-not-exists flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo
flatpak install --user flathub org.freedesktop.Platform//25.08
flatpak install --user ./plezy-linux-x64.flatpak
flatpak run com.edde746.plezy
```

On arm64, install `plezy-linux-arm64.flatpak`.

<details>
<summary>Sandbox, playback, and folder access</summary>

- Not on Flathub — the remote supplies the Freedesktop runtime only.
- Video playback needs a Wayland session; a pure X11 session shows the interface but cannot create the video plane.
- No host or home filesystem access; app data lives in `~/.var/app/com.edde746.plezy/`. Add host folders through the desktop file chooser portal, and keep download folders writable.
- Network, display, audio, and device access are enabled. `--device=all` (Flatpak 1.14 compatibility) exposes more than GPUs and controllers; session-bus access stays filtered.

## Building from Source

### Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK 3.47.0+
- A Plex account, or a Jellyfin or Emby server with user credentials

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/edde746/plezy.git
cd plezy
flutter pub get
scripts/codegen.sh
flutter run
```

After modifying translations:

```bash
dart run slang

<details>
<summary>Packaging a Flatpak bundle</summary>

Packages an **already fully resolved Linux release bundle** — pinned libmpv and bundled libraries included, not a Flathub source-build manifest. Run it on Linux, on the same architecture as the bundle, after following the bundle preparation steps in [the Linux release workflow](.github/workflows/build.yml): `flutter build linux` alone does not produce all the required bundled libraries.

Install the packaging tools (Debian/Ubuntu shown) plus the native-architecture SDK and runtime:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y flatpak flatpak-builder imagemagick
flatpak remote-add --user --if-not-exists flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo
flatpak install --user flathub org.freedesktop.Platform//25.08 org.freedesktop.Sdk//25.08

BUNDLE_DIR=build/linux/x64/release/bundle
python3 linux/packaging/build-flatpak.py --bundle "$BUNDLE_DIR" --arch x64 --output "$PWD"
```

That writes `plezy-linux-x64.flatpak`, installable with the Flatpak commands above; on arm64, use the prepared arm64 bundle directory and `--arch arm64`. Package from the checkout matching the bundle, since the version comes from `pubspec.yaml`.

Cross-architecture packaging needs native Flatpak tools, a registered binfmt interpreter, and the target SDK/runtime installed with `flatpak install --user --arch=x86_64` (or `aarch64`) — never run Flatpak's namespace tools under emulation. Pass `--arch x64` or `--arch arm64` to the checker and the matching Flatpak architecture to `flatpak run --arch=...`.

Check the installed package against the runtime (not just the SDK), then launch it on a Wayland desktop and exercise streaming, audio, downloads/offline playback, and file chooser portals:

```bash
python3 linux/packaging/check-flatpak.py
```

The check fails on a non-executable entry point or an unresolved bundled ELF dependency. A container without a GPU can use `flatpak run --env=GALLIUM_DRIVER=softpipe com.edde746.plezy` for software-rendered verification; this is not a hardware-decoding or HDR test.

<details>
<summary>Local checks</summary>

```bash
scripts/ci_checks.sh
```

To install the same pre-commit checks locally:

```bash
scripts/setup_hooks.sh
```

End-to-end tests (Android emulator plus a Dockerized Jellyfin fixture):

```bash
python3 scripts/maestro/run_maestro.py basic
```
